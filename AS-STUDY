 What I found is that dreams often react how you think they’ll react, whether you want them to or not. And since you’ve had many unstable dreams then you probably expect your next dream to be unstable too - and so it probably will be.

As soon as I feel my dream slipping away or myself waking up I’ll quickly grab something in the dream, a leaf, a book, anything, and really focus on feeling the texture in my hand and looking closely at the details of what I’m holding, grounding myself and stabilizing the dream.

Or even simpler, tell yourself you have “dream stabilizing pills” in your back pocket. Quickly take them when your dream is fading and you’ll be fine. If you believe something will work then it most likely will work
