s soon as I feel my dream slipping away or myself waking up I’ll quickly grab something in the dream, a leaf, a book, anything, and really focus on feeling the texture in my hand and looking closely at the details of what I’m holding, grounding myself and stabilizing the dream.

Or even simpler, tell yourself you have “dream stabilizing pills” in your back pocket. Quickly take them when your dream is fading and you’ll be fine. If you believe something will work then it most likely will work.
