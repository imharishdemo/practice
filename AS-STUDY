amygdala

🧠 Emotion processing: It helps you recognize and respond to emotions, especially fear, anger, and pleasure.
⚡ Fight-or-flight: The amygdala quickly evaluates threats and can trigger stress responses (like increased heart rate or release of adrenaline).
📝 Emotional memory: It helps attach emotions to memories, making emotionally charged events easier to remember.
🤝 Social behavior: It plays a role in interpreting facial expressions and social cues.

Damage or dysfunction in the amygdala can lead to
Reduced fear or aggression (if it’s destroyed on both sides).
Heightened anxiety or phobias (if it’s overactive).
Difficulty recognizing emotions in others

Emotional memories

Amygdala – Adds an emotional “tag” (fear, pleasure, etc.) that makes certain memories stronger.
