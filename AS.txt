Good question 👍.
If you want to understand how AS works in the body, you’ll need to look at how different systems of the body and brain react to fear, stress, and social situations. Here are the main things you should study:


---

1. Brain Regions

Amygdala → detects threats and creates the “fear” response. Often overactive in AS.

Prefrontal cortex → helps with reasoning and controlling fear, but in AS it can be less effective at calming the amygdala.

Hippocampus → stores memories of past social experiences, which can influence how you react now.



---

2. Nervous System

Autonomic nervous system (ANS) → controls automatic reactions like sweating, blushing, trembling.

Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) → “fight or flight,” kicks in when you feel judged or embarrassed.

Parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) → calms you down, but in AS it may be less active.



---

3. Hormones & Neurotransmitters

Cortisol → stress hormone, often elevated in AS.

Adrenaline (epinephrine) → makes heart beat faster, causes shaking.

Serotonin → important for mood regulation, imbalances linked to AS.

GABA → calming neurotransmitter; lower activity may mean less ability to relax.

4. Physical Reactions in the Body

Increased heart rate

Shallow breathing

Blushing

Sweating

Dry mouth

Muscle tension


These are the physical signs people often notice during AS.

5. Mind-Body Connection

How thoughts (like fear of embarrassment) trigger physical responses.

The role of conditioning (bad past experiences making your body react strongly to similar situations).

👉 So, if you’re studying, focus on neuroscience, psychology, physiology, and stress biology.

Do you want me to make you a step-by-step study plan (like which topic to learn first, second, etc.) so it’s easier to approach?
